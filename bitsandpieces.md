# development culture components

* Communicate all decisions made to your team (in-house and outsourced): Critical decisions are often times made in an informal tone or setting. This can result in lots of wasted time before every office and team member involved knows of the updates and stops working on outdated information. Instead of sending out decisions through email or chat, you do better if you add it to a corporate wiki or guide for faster access to everyone involved. You can also ask team members to set up email notifications for important pages or groups.

* Minimize environment friction during set up: Creating a simple getting started guide will do wonders in terms of increasing productivity. Instead of scheduling for one-on-one sessions (these can be done later for confirmation and feedback), you need to automate your setup whenever possible.

* Clearly define a “complete” objective: A concrete definition of a “complete” task will eliminate vague work. It is in the interest of everyone involved to craft and distribute a list of project objectives. Such objectives clarify when your project is done. For example, you want to clarify when code is designed, created, tested, and reviewed.

* Publish guidelines for filing bug reports: Not everyone in your outsource dev team might be available in case an issue comes up, but that cannot stand in the way of progress. You will want to ensure in advance that all team members can file an all-inclusive bug report. And, shared troubleshooting guides make it easy for everyone to track, fix and validate issues.
